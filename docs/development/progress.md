# Implementation progress

The goal remains the complete planned Linux backend and administrator dashboard. A completed engineering increment does not establish full Emby compatibility.

## Decisions

- Develop directly on `main`; commit and push each completed increment.
- Use PostgreSQL exclusively; the earlier SQLite proposal is superseded.
- Pin Go **1.27.1** and FFmpeg **9.0.1**, reconfirmed from official stable-release sources on 2026-09-10.
- Include explicit hardware **decode** and **encode** selection and evidence; software-only success is not GPU verification.
- Local compilation/build checks are authorized. Execute functional tests, runtime probes, media tests, and browser tests through `ssh test-env`.

## Increment status

| Increment | Status | Evidence / remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Research baseline and PostgreSQL/toolchain decisions | Complete as a documentation increment | Pushed `baa3731`: pinned upstream catalog, scope, PostgreSQL architecture and toolchain provenance |
| Linux toolchain and database provisioning | Complete | Pushed `79745ce`: Go 1.27.1, FFmpeg 9.0.1 and PostgreSQL 17.11; software media verification passed |
| M0 core reference capture | Baseline complete; broader coverage pending | Official Emby 4.9.5.0 isolated on test-env, 958 audited records including HTTP/WebSocket/media observations; the latest metadata study adds 130 records with 106 complete HTTP exchanges. Global NextUp selection remains unresolved; [HTTP](../research/reference-server.md), [WebSocket](../research/websocket-reference.md), [HLS](../research/hls-reference.md), [audio](../research/audio-reference.md), [audio profiles](../research/audio-profile-reference.md), [video profiles](../research/video-progressive-reference.md), [metadata](../research/metadata-reference.md) |
| M1 service, identity, administrator foundation | Foundation increment complete | PostgreSQL migrations, users/sessions, setup/login, CSRF, proxy-aware rate limits, React/MUI overview/user creation, non-root Linux deployment; [verification report](verification-m1.md) |
| M2a media ingestion and browse | Complete | Pushed `90b7c2e`: safe ffprobe, bounded scans, PostgreSQL catalog/ownership, library ACL queries and React/MUI Libraries/Tasks; [verification report](verification-m2a.md) |
| M2b metadata and artwork | Local NFO, entities, and local artwork increments complete | Pushed NFO increment `6011377`; persistent entity navigation/filtering and bounded image delivery pass full Linux race tests and deployed checks; [NFO verification](verification-m2b-nfo.md), [artwork/entity verification](verification-m2b-artwork-entities.md). Generated/embedded artwork, broader metadata/query coverage and reconciliation remain |
| Startup and migration time budgets | Complete | Configurable `GOBY_STARTUP_TIMEOUT`, migration-local SQL timeout override, cancellation and connection-setting restoration verified; [verification](verification-startup-timeouts.md) |
| M3 initial client playback | Original playback/state, client sessions/NextUp, external SRT/WebVTT, and user-state events/remote-control increments complete; milestone incomplete | Full Linux race tests and deployed workflows passed; [M3a](verification-m3a-original-playback.md), [M3b](verification-m3b-sessions-nextup.md), [M3c](verification-m3c-subtitles.md), [M3d](verification-m3d-events.md). Additional events/subscriptions, broader subtitle handling, global NextUp parity and real-client acceptance remain |
| M4 conversion and hardware pipeline | Engine, HLS VOD, progressive audio/video, ordered profiles and verified video restart increments complete; milestone incomplete | [M4a](verification-m4a-engine.md), [M4b](verification-m4b-hls.md), [M4c](verification-m4c-audio.md), [M4d](verification-m4d-audio-profiles.md) and [M4e](verification-m4e-video-and-users.md) establish the preceding conversion and clock behavior. [M4f](verification-m4f-video-seek.md) adds probe 6 private restart evidence, software-decoder proof with actual threads, and independent linear audio. All 940 top-level race tests and five deployed library upgrades passed with real fast producer observation. Nonzero copied-video seeking, efficient audio I/O, explicit index rebuilding, additional tracks/formats, aggregate resource isolation, actual GPU execution and full client acceptance remain |
| M5 administrator completion | User and metadata-management increments complete; milestone incomplete | [M5a](verification-m4e-video-and-users.md) covers accounts, policies and revocation. [M5b](verification-m5b-metadata.md) adds schema 14, library item management, persistent automatic/manual/locked metadata, source revisions, inactive-setting cleanup, and browser/restart/migration evidence. Full policies, online providers, tasks/devices/keys/settings, audit/log browsing, backup and restore remain |
| M6 compatibility release | Pending | Client/reference comparisons, Linux distribution/architecture/GPU matrix, operations, representative large-catalog upgrade timing, and recovery evidence |
| M7 additional features | Deferred per scope | Explicit feature decisions and their own acceptance gates |

## Environment observations

`test-env` is reachable as a Debian 13 Linux host. Its root filesystem was initially full; disposable caches were reclaimed while preserving unrelated running workloads. Go and media build caches use dedicated scratch locations. No GPU device was present in the `/dev/dri` and `/dev/nvidia0` inspection. Hardware command generation can be tested there, but actual GPU execution requires suitable hardware and remains unverified.

The current service is active as the unprivileged `goby` user at `http://127.0.0.1:18096` on the test host, with schema 14 and probe version 6. M4f passed 940 top-level tests across all twelve tested packages with zero skips. Its binary upgrade preserved all seventeen public tables, and subsequent normal scans preserved metadata/user state while enabling an observed fast producer. The concurrent M5c administrator-session work is not part of this checkpoint. Credentials remain in root-only environment files on that host. It is a test deployment, not a public production release.

No milestone is complete solely because its build passes. Each implementation increment will append exact test/build results and its pushed revision here or in the corresponding verification report.
