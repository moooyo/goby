# Implementation progress

The goal remains the complete planned Linux backend and administrator dashboard. A completed engineering increment does not establish full Emby compatibility.

## Decisions

- Develop directly on `main`; commit and push each completed increment.
- Use PostgreSQL exclusively; the earlier SQLite proposal is superseded.
- Pin Go **1.27.1** and FFmpeg **9.0.1**, reconfirmed from official stable-release sources on 2026-09-10.
- Include explicit hardware **decode** and **encode** selection and evidence; software-only success is not GPU verification.
- Local compilation/build checks are authorized. Execute functional tests, runtime probes, media tests, and browser tests through `ssh test-env`.

## Increment status

| Increment | Status | Evidence / remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Research baseline and PostgreSQL/toolchain decisions | Complete as a documentation increment | Pushed `baa3731`: pinned upstream catalog, scope, PostgreSQL architecture and toolchain provenance |
| Linux toolchain and database provisioning | Complete | Pushed `79745ce`: Go 1.27.1, FFmpeg 9.0.1 and PostgreSQL 17.11; software media verification passed |
| M0 core reference capture | Baseline complete; broader coverage pending | Official Emby 4.9.5.0 isolated on test-env, 1006 audited records including HTTP/WebSocket/media observations; the latest [application-key study](../research/api-key-reference.md) adds 48 records with 47 complete HTTP exchanges. Independent userless application-key authority is confirmed; implementation remains pending. Global NextUp selection remains unresolved; [HTTP](../research/reference-server.md), [WebSocket](../research/websocket-reference.md), [HLS](../research/hls-reference.md), [audio](../research/audio-reference.md), [audio profiles](../research/audio-profile-reference.md), [video profiles](../research/video-progressive-reference.md), [metadata](../research/metadata-reference.md) |
| M1 service, identity, administrator foundation | Foundation increment complete | PostgreSQL migrations, users/sessions, setup/login, CSRF, proxy-aware rate limits, React/MUI overview/user creation, non-root Linux deployment; [verification report](verification-m1.md) |
| M2a media ingestion and browse | Complete | Pushed `90b7c2e`: safe ffprobe, bounded scans, PostgreSQL catalog/ownership, library ACL queries and React/MUI Libraries/Tasks; [verification report](verification-m2a.md) |
| M2b metadata and artwork | Local NFO, entities, and local artwork increments complete | Pushed NFO increment `6011377`; persistent entity navigation/filtering and bounded image delivery pass full Linux race tests and deployed checks; [NFO verification](verification-m2b-nfo.md), [artwork/entity verification](verification-m2b-artwork-entities.md). Generated/embedded artwork, broader metadata/query coverage and reconciliation remain |
| Startup and migration time budgets | Complete | Configurable `GOBY_STARTUP_TIMEOUT`, migration-local SQL timeout override, cancellation and connection-setting restoration verified; [verification](verification-startup-timeouts.md) |
| M3 initial client playback | Original playback/state, client sessions/NextUp, external SRT/WebVTT, and user-state events/remote-control increments complete; milestone incomplete | Full Linux race tests and deployed workflows passed; [M3a](verification-m3a-original-playback.md), [M3b](verification-m3b-sessions-nextup.md), [M3c](verification-m3c-subtitles.md), [M3d](verification-m3d-events.md). Additional events/subscriptions, broader subtitle handling, global NextUp parity and real-client acceptance remain |
| M4 conversion and hardware pipeline | Engine, HLS VOD, progressive audio/video, ordered profiles and verified video restart increments complete; milestone incomplete | [M4a](verification-m4a-engine.md), [M4b](verification-m4b-hls.md), [M4c](verification-m4c-audio.md), [M4d](verification-m4d-audio-profiles.md) and [M4e](verification-m4e-video-and-users.md) establish the preceding conversion and clock behavior. [M4f](verification-m4f-video-seek.md) adds probe 6 private restart evidence, software-decoder proof with actual threads, and independent linear audio. All 940 top-level race tests and five deployed library upgrades passed with real fast producer observation. Nonzero copied-video seeking, efficient audio I/O, explicit index rebuilding, additional tracks/formats, aggregate resource isolation, actual GPU execution and full client acceptance remain |
| M5 administrator completion | User, metadata and login-session management increments complete; milestone incomplete | [M5a](verification-m4e-video-and-users.md) covers accounts and policies. [M5b](verification-m5b-metadata.md) adds schema 14 and persistent metadata edits/locks. [M5c](verification-m5c-sessions.md) adds login lists/filters, transaction-checked single-session revocation, self-sign-out, targeted runtime retirement, browser/restart and deployed preservation evidence. All 954 top-level race tests pass. Full policies, online providers, generic tasks, complete devices/keys/settings, audit/log browsing, backup and restore remain |
| M6 compatibility release | Pending | Client/reference comparisons, Linux distribution/architecture/GPU matrix, operations, representative large-catalog upgrade timing, and recovery evidence |
| M7 additional features | Deferred per scope | Explicit feature decisions and their own acceptance gates |

## Environment observations

`test-env` is reachable as a Debian 13 Linux host. Its root filesystem was initially full; disposable caches were reclaimed while preserving unrelated running workloads. Go and media build caches use dedicated scratch locations. No GPU device was present in the `/dev/dri` and `/dev/nvidia0` inspection. Hardware command generation can be tested there, but actual GPU execution requires suitable hardware and remains unverified.

The current service is active as the unprivileged `goby` user at `http://127.0.0.1:18096` on the test host, with schema 14 and probe version 6. M5c passed 954 top-level tests across all twelve tested packages with zero skips, browser/restart acceptance and the deployed session API workflow. Its binary/interface upgrade preserved all seventeen public tables, and live verification changed only its three new authentication rows, all revoked at completion. M4f's verified video restart remains in place. Credentials remain in root-only environment files on that host. It is a test deployment, not a public production release.

No milestone is complete solely because its build passes. Each implementation increment will append exact test/build results and its pushed revision here or in the corresponding verification report.
